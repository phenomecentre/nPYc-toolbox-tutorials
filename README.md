The tutorials in this repository use Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the application of the nPYc-Toolbox for the preprocessing and quality control of LC-MS and NMR metabolic profiling data.


The dataset used in these tutorials (DEVSET) is comprised of six samples of pooled human urine, aliquoted, and independently prepared and measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to reversed-phase positive ionisation mode spectrometry (LC-MS, RPOS) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Each source sample was separately prepared and assayed thirteen times. A pooled QC sample (study reference, SR) and independent external reference (long-term reference, LTR) of a comparable matrix was also acquired to assist in assessing analytical precision.
