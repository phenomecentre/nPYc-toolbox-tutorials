    "The nPYc-Toolbox provides the capacity to generate a principal component analysis (PCA) model of the data (via the [pyChemometrics](https://github.com/phenomecentre/pyChemometrics) module), and subesquently, to use this to assess data quality, identify potential sample and feature outliers, and determine any potential analytical associations with the main sources of variance in the data ([Multivariate Analysis](https://npyc-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multivariate.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "A PCA model can be generated using 'exploratoryAnalysisPCA', and there are a number of parameters which can be optimised depending on the dataset (see [PCA Model](https://npyc-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multivariate.html#pca-model) for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "One key parameter is 'scaling', which divides each column in the data matrix by its respective standard deviation raised to a power of the scaling parameter. This parameter can range in value between 0 and 1, and recommended values are 0 for mean-centering only, 0.5 for Pareto scaling and 1 for unit variance (UV) scaling. The outcome of PCA model will vary based on the scaling method selected, and different scaling functions can be appropriate depending on the data itself and the question being asked of the data, see [van der Berg et al. 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16762068)\n",
    "\n",
    "The default scaling is unit variance (\"scaling=1\"), which scales every variable to have a variance of one, and thus all variables (despite their different magnitudes) become equally important in the model. For NMR, when smaller variables are more likely to be background noise, it may be that mean-centering the data only (\"scaling=0\") can be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model is cross-validated using 7-fold cross-validation and the recommended number of principal components automatically estimated based on two criteria, when either one of these is met no more components will be added and the PCA model will be returned. There criteria are:\n",
    "1. \"minQ2\": Q2 is the variance predicted by each component (from cross-validation), when adding a component does not improve Q2 by at least this value (default \"minQ2=0.05\") then no more components will be added.\n",
    "2. \"maxComponents\": this defines the maximum number of components (default \"maxComponents=10\") returned by the model (regardless of Q2 increases).\n",
